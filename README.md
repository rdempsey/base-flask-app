# Base Flask App

This is a base Flask app with batteries included.  There's a ton of pre-packaged goodness in here for you, which should help you get started on your next project. Here's the list:

* Fully implemented Bootstrap theme: Readable.
* Over 250 glyphs like this one  in font format from the Glyphicon Halflings set.
* Done-for-you drop-down menus just waiting for you to expand the app and your own urls.
* Custom favicon made from the Flask logo. Just replace it with yours.
* JQuery v2.2.3
* D3.js v3.5.16
* Moment.js v2.12.0 - so you can parse, validate, manipulate, and display dates in JavaScript.
* BootStrap DateTimePicker - use this to make your datetime picker look super hot.
* Everything has been extracted from apps I've created for work and others.

Now clone this repo, get to customizing and enjoy!
